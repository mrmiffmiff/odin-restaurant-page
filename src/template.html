        <!-- <p>Now, I know what you're thinking. A kosher pizza restaurant? In Oakland? Yes, it's something we've all wanted
            for ages, but it's just a pipe dream, we can't actually have it. It simply wouldn't make money. It would
            cost more to maintain than it would make. No profits. Would hemorrhage money. Couldn't stay afloat. Just
            can't be done.</p> !-->
