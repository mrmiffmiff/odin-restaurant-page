Restaurant Page Project for The Odin Project

This is a bit tongue-in-cheek on my part; there are individuals within Oakland's Orthodox Jewish community (myself included) that do, in fact, wish to create a kosher pizza restaurant in Oakland. Alas, we all know it's a pipe dream, as there would be far too many obstacles to doing so in this area. But it's good to dream. This is, hopefully, only just barely what its home page would look like.
